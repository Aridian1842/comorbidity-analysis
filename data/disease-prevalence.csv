# Percentage prevalance of diseases in the United States general population 
# in CSV format
# 1st column is prevalance value in percentage (so 1.72 is 1.72 %)
# 2nd column is disease name
# Use 314 million as the United States 2012 population 
# Use 311 million as the United States 2011 population 
# Use 281 million as the United States 2000 population 
# Figure out how to convert from incidence rate and prevalence rate.
# Is prevalence the correct normalization measure? 
# If disease is lethal (patient die), then how does this effect prevalance rate?
