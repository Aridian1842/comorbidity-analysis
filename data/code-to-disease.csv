# Mapping from ICD-9 code to disease name (derived SI-Appendix 3 of Rzhetsky 
# et. al. 2007)
#
# I removed comma from these disease name, so that text can be more
# conveniently parsed:
# (1) "Breast cancer, female" becomes "Breast cancer (female)"
# (2) "Breast cancer, male" becomes "Breast cancer (male)"
# (3) "Cardiomyopathy, primary" becomes "Cardiomyopathy (primary)"
#
# I commented out these lines:
# (1) "277.0","Amino acid (AA) transport disorders"
#     Reason: this ICD-9 belongs to "Cystic fibrosis".
# (2) "237.70","Carcinoma in situ"
#     Reason: this ICD-9 more accurately maps to "Neurofibromatosis"
# (3) "237.71","Carcinoma in situ"
#     Reason: this ICD-9 more accurately maps to "Neurofibromatosis"
# (4) "237.72","Carcinoma in situ"
#     Reason: this ICD-9 more accurately maps to "Neurofibromatosis"
# (5) "272.8","Lipid metabolism disorders"
#     Reason:  this is a duplicated entry.
# (6) "299.00","Pervasive developmental disorders"
#     Reason:  this ICD-9 more accurately maps to "Autism"
# (7) "299.01","Pervasive developmental disorders"
#     Reason: this ICD-9 more accurately maps to "Autism"
#
# I modified these lines:
# (1) "29624","Depression" to "296.24","Depression"
# (2) "29625","Depression" to "296.25","Depression"
# (3) "29626","Depression" to "296.26","Depression"
# (4) "29630","Depression" to "296.30","Depression"
# (5) "29631","Depression" to "296.31","Depression"
# (6) "29632","Depression" to "296.32","Depression"
# (7) "29633","Depression" to "296.33","Depression"
# (8) "29634","Depression" to "296.34","Depression"
# (9) "29635","Depression" to "296.35","Depression"
